## DESCRIPTION
Applying javascript to data analytics and visualization. Specifically, the focus is on building a dynamic webpage, one that accepts user inputs and adjust accordingly. In more concrete terms we build a table to hold and neatly display the data we want to work with. 
Then will add filters to the table to let users refine their search on more than one level.
