Using Javascript to pull and organize data

# Purpose of the Project
In this project we are applying javascript to data analytics and visualization. Specifically, the focus is on building a dynamic webpage, one that accepts user inputs and adjust accordingly. In more concrete terms we build a table to hold and neatly display the data we want to work with. Then will add filters to the table to let users refine their search on more than one level.


# The Technologies Used
Javascript , Basic HTML, CSS, Chrome DevTools, Bootstrap


# 1 Recommendation for Further Development 
Strategically planned non-intrusive pop-ups that could help educate and take readers/users to the next step of their search.
